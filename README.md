# Employee Tracker App Refactor

1. I was asked to refactor preexisting code to reference a add employee button.
2. Cycle through prompts to add data to an empty array by utilizing a while loop until the user terminates the loop.
3. Provide logic to push user inputted object data into the empty array.
4. Provide function logic to a function that will calculate the average salary of all the objects data inputted by the user.
5. Lastly I was asked to randomly select a employee from the array of objects to be selected for a random drawing.

## Installation

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript based starter code in this process. I then created a webpage on gitpages from my github project repo.
```

## Usage

This refactor will be used to deploy a functioning employee tracker app webpage.
```

## Contributing

I worked mostly on my own but with input/advice from several members of my bootcamp class.
